`pdftk` is a command like tool to manipulate (merge, extract, encrypt, etc) pdf files. On Ubuntu you can install from it from the repositories, like:

```sh
sudo apt install pdftk
```

## Extract pages from a long pdf

Take `long.pdf` and cut out pages 5-14 to `output_pp5_14.pdf`.

```sh
pdftk long.pdf cat 5-14 output_pp5_14.pdf`
```

## Merge two or more files

You should list each files to add, use `cat output` option and name your new merged file. 

```sh
pdftk file1.pdf file2.pdf cat output newfile_merged.pdf
```
To merge all pdf in a folder, you can use `*` (wildcard) instead of listing each files.
